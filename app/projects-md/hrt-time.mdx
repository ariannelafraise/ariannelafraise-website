# HRT Time

[Github repository](https://github.com/ariannelafraise/hrt-time)‚Üó

My personal bash script to display an HRT timer. I'm using it for my waybar!

## Usage
**Dependency: bc**
1. Change this line with your HRT date.
```bash
secondsThen=$(date -d "october 17 2024 19:00" +%s)
```
2. Add this to your waybar config: (replace hours with whichever units you'd like)
```jsonc
"modules-left": [
"custom/hrt"
]

"custom/hrt": {
    "format": "üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è {}",
    "exec": "~/hrt-time/hrt-time.sh hours",
    "interval": 10,
    "tooltip": false
}
```
