# My personal website

[Github repository](https://github.com/ariannelafraise/ariannelafraise-website)↗

A Next.js website that I’m building as a static site, hosted on GitHub Pages.
It features Continuous Deployment (CD) using GitHub Actions, so any updates pushed
to the main branch are automatically built and deployed!

## Skills I used for this project
- Continuous Deployment (CD) with Github Actions
- Web development using React/Next.js
- Web design

## Markdown articles
I also added a feature to generate pages (like this one) from Markdown files for each of my projects.

All I need to do is to make a Markdown file like this in the projects directory:

**very-cool-project.mdx**

![project file example](/media/personal-website/project-file-example.png)

Aaaannnd it will automatically become a page!
