## Nerdy details
This is a Next.js website that Iâ€™m building as a static site, hosted on GitHub Pages.
It features Continuous Deployment (CD) using GitHub Actions, so any updates pushed to the main branch are automatically deployed!

I have also added a feature to generate pages (like this one) from markdown files for each of my projects.

All I have to do is to make a markdown file like this:

very-cool-project.mdx
```mdx
---
id: "very-cool-project" // This is the same as the name of the file
name: "Very cool project"
description: "My very cool project!!"
priority: 10 // To determine its position in the projects list
---
# Very cool project
this is my very cool project :D
<img src="https://paintilya.dev/very-cool-image.png" alt="a very cool image"/>

## Example
- Hey 1
- Hey 2
- Hey 3
```

Aaaannnd it will be automatically become a page!
