<h1 style="color: #5dc9ff;">Shark Names You</h1>

A web application made to help transgender individuals choose a name. It uses data from
[Données Québec](https://www.donneesquebec.ca/)↗, therefore making it targeted towards french-speaking people.
It is closed-source for security concerns.

**This application is in (very) early development. It isn't available to be used/tried yet.**

## Skills I'm using/developing in this project
- Backend development using Spring (Java)
- Web development using React/Next.js/Tailwind
- Token-based authentication
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Data preprocessing

## Data
The data used in this project comes from [Données Québec](https://www.donneesquebec.ca/)↗. 
They update their data every year during Spring.
**It is NOT representative of how many people actually have that name in Quebec.**
