# Shark Names You
**/!\ This application is in (very) early development. It isn't available to be used/tried yet. /!\\**

A web application made to help transgender individuals choose a name. It uses data from [Données Québec](https://www.donneesquebec.ca/)↗, therefore making it targeted towards french-speaking people.

## Github repositories

- [Data tool](https://github.com/ariannelafraise/shark-names-you-quebec-data-tool)↗

## Data
The data used in this project comes from [Données Québec](https://www.donneesquebec.ca/)↗, which was transformed with a [data manipulation tool](https://github.com/ariannelafraise/shark-names-you-quebec-data-tool)↗. 
They update their data every year during Spring.
**It is NOT representative of how many people actually have that name in Quebec.**
