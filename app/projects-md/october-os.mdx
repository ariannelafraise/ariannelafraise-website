# October Linux

[Github Organization](https://github.com/october-os)↗

Unlike Arch Linux, which only offers a base system through manual installation, October Linux provides a disk image featuring an installer written in Go, enabling a guided, fast, and automated setup. The installer deploys a complete system including a pre-configured desktop environment and essential applications to deliver an out-of-the-box experience, while remaining as faithful as possible to the minimalist philosophy of Arch.
This project is currently under development; we are aiming to release our first version very soon.
