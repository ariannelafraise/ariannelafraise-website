A Python framework designed for processing, analyzing, and managing events generated by the Linux Audit subsystem.
It relies on an Inversion of Control (IoC) model: developers can register their own event handlers, while the framework automatically handles receiving, deserializing, grouping, and distributing events. The Observer design pattern is utilized to route events efficiently.
With this tool, developing applications that react to system events, such as for security monitoring, becomes straightforward.
This project is currently under development; I am aiming for an initial release very soon.
